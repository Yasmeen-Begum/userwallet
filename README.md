**1. Method Chosen: Random Forest Regression**

- **Random Forest Regressor** is an ensemble algorithm that builds multiple decision trees on randomly sampled data and feature subsets. 
- Each tree predicts a numerical output; the final prediction is the average of all trees’ predictions.
- This method is robust against overfitting, handles non-linear relationships, and can naturally quantify feature importance.

**2. Complete Architecture**

- **Data ingestion:** Reads JSON wallet transaction data, flattens nested fields.
- **Preprocessing:** 
  - Normalizes timestamp formats.
  - Converts amounts to numeric.
  - Lowercases and standardizes action codes.

- **Feature Engineering:** 
  - Aggregates wallet activity (e.g., total deposit/borrow, number of transactions).
  - Computes ratios (repayment, liquidation, deposit-to-borrow), and wallet “activity level.”

- **Target Score Construction:** 
  - Simulates a true credit score using a heuristic combination of engineered features (reflecting likely financial health), then scales between **300–1000**.
  
- **Model Training:** 
  - **Splits** the dataset into train and test subsets.
  - Trains a Random Forest Regressor on all features except wallet address.
  - Predicts scores for all users.

- **Analysis:** 
  - Shows predicted score distribution and saves wallet score results.

**3. Processing Flow in Code Terms**

Below is a structured outline of the algorithm, mapped directly to the code steps:

```python
1. Load JSON data into a flat pandas DataFrame:
    df = load_data(json_path)
 
2. Preprocess:
    - Convert timestamps and amounts.
    - Standardize action field.

3. Feature Engineering:
    - For each wallet, compute financial aggregates and behavior ratios.
    - Assemble feature rows per wallet.

4. Simulate true credit scores (since true labels are absent):
    - Combine repayment, liquidation, deposit/borrow ratios, and activity level with fixed weights.
    - Add small random noise for realism.
    - Scale scores to range [300, 1000].

5. Model Training:
    - Drop identifying/user columns; retain only features.
    - Split into training and validation sets.
    - Fit RandomForestRegressor on features → simulated “true_score”.

6. Scoring and Output:
    - Predict scores for all wallets, round and clip to [0, 1000].
    - Assign predicted scores to users.

7. Analysis and Visualization:
    - Bin scores into ranges (300-400, …, 900-1000).
    - Save a bar chart showing how many wallets fall into each bin.
    - Export individual wallet scores to CSV.
```

code executing command :  python score_wallet.py user-wallet-transactions.json


**4. Why Random Forest?**

- **Handles heterogeneous and non-linear features** without strong parametric assumptions.
- **Resistant to overfitting** due to ensemble averaging.
- **Explains feature contributions**: can reveal which wallet behaviors most influence credit scores.
- **Robust to noisy, missing, and correlated data**—common in financial and blockchain transaction logs.

**5. Key Code Snippet (Model Training & Prediction)**
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Inputs: features_df (with precomputed ratios and behavior scores)
X = features_df.drop(columns=['userWallet', 'true_score'])
y = features_df['true_score']

# Train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model initialization and training
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Prediction
features_df['predicted_score'] = model.predict(X).clip(0, 1000).round(2)
```
---

**6. Limitations & Assumptions**
- The “true” credit score is simulated using heuristics, not ground-truth label data. Thus, model accuracy reflects the reproducibility of this constructed score, not real-world creditworthiness.
- The code expects clean JSON input structured per-wallet with transaction attributes.

For real deployment, one would:
- Use actual credit outcomes as ground truth if available.
- Regularly retrain the model as financial behaviors and risk factors evolve.
